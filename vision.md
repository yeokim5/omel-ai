Omel AI - Product Manual v1.0
What is Omel AI?
Omel AI is the Final Safety Layer for Unreliable AI Chatbots. It sits between your AI chatbot (Gubagoo, Impel, Sierra, etc.) and your customers—catching hallucinations, false promises, and dangerous responses before they ever reach a real person.
Omel = Omega (The Last Layer)
Think of it like a bouncer at a nightclub: the AI is the DJ (sometimes playing the right music, sometimes playing requests that shouldn't exist). Omel is the bouncer who stops the bad requests from reaching the dance floor.

The Problem We Solve
Your AI chatbot is broken in ways you can't fix:
It hallucinates: "Sure, I'll sell you that time machine for $100,000!"
It breaks your policies: "Yes, you get free oil changes for life!"
It misquotes rates: "0% APR guaranteed" (when the offer expired yesterday).
It wastes your team's time: Bad leads clog your CRM. Your sales team chases fake customers.
Your chatbot vendor (Gubagoo, Impel) doesn't care. Their goal is Sales Conversion, not Safety. They turn off the guardrails to boost lead volume.
Omel steps in where they failed.

How Omel Works
The Flow (4 Simple Steps)
text
1. CUSTOMER TYPES MESSAGE
   "I have a 2010 Honda with 200k miles. Can you guarantee $8,000 for it?"
          ↓
2. AI CHATBOT RESPONDS (Dangerous)
   "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with $8,000 for your trade-in!"
          ↓
3. OMEL INTERCEPTS & ANALYZES
   Judge Model: "Is this safe?"
   Analysis: "This is a specific price promise WITHOUT vehicle inspection."
   Verdict: ❌ UNSAFE
          ↓
4. OMEL REPLACES WITH SAFE RESPONSE
   Customer Sees: "We'd love to appraise your vehicle! Please visit us in person for an accurate trade-in valuation."
   Alert stored in dashboard: "⚠️ Bot blocked a $8k trade-in promise. Check dashboard."

What Omel Blocks
Category 1: Price Promises
❌ "I'll guarantee you $5,000 for your trade-in."
✅ Replaced: "We'll evaluate your trade-in. Visit us for a free appraisal."
Category 2: Policy Hallucinations
❌ "Yes, we offer free lifetime oil changes!"
✅ Replaced: "Our service team can discuss your vehicle needs in person."
Category 3: Rate Misquotes
❌ "0% APR on all vehicles!"
✅ Replaced: "Financing options available for qualified buyers. Visit us for details."
Category 4: Absurd Requests
❌ "Sure, we accept time machines as trade-ins!"
✅ Replaced: "We accept standard vehicles. Please visit our dealership."
