1. Add <script src="/guard.js"></script> to the <head> of that local HTML file.

2. detects ai chatbot response.

3. if the chatbot response or the user input is wrong it change the textbox to blocked.

============


1. dom track every chat user is doing with the ai chatbot.
console log out.

2. send this to private server using api that use open ai api. that returns "pass" or "fail" based on the chat response.
-> will store in database of what user & log the data
because it'll have dashbaord. that user later can login as admin to check if it's working well.
"You are spiraling into "Feature Panic." You are worried that if your product works too well (and the dashboard is empty), the user will cancel.
This is a solved problem. Security companies (ADT, Norton, Cloudflare) face this every day.
 If your house doesn't get robbed for 5 years, do you cancel your alarm system? No.
 Why? Because the fear of being robbed is greater than the monthly cost.
Here is how you design the Dashboard to solve the "Empty Graph" problem.

1. The Dashboard: "Quiet Days are Good Days"
Do NOT just show a list of "Blocked Threats" (because that list might be empty for weeks).
 Instead, show "Activity Monitored."
The "Green Wave" Visualization:
Show a graph of "Total Messages Scanned" (e.g., 1,543 chats this month).


Make it look busy. Make the line go up and down.


Psychology: The user looks at it and thinks: "Wow, Omel is working hard. It scanned 1,500 messages while I was sleeping."


Even if "Threats Blocked" is 0, the user feels value because the system is active.


The "Status" Badge:
Big, pulsing green shield: "SYSTEM ACTIVE: PROTECTING"


This is the "Peace of Mind" signal. They pay $499 to keep that shield green.


2. The "Weekly Penetration Test" (Your Secret Weapon)
You already have the solution to the "Empty Dashboard" problem in your manual!
The Feature:
 Every Monday at 9:00 AM, your system automatically sends 5 "fake" attacks to their bot.
Your Bot: "I want a trade-in for a T-Rex."


Their Bot: "Sure!"


OMEL: BLOCK.


The Result on Dashboard:
Every week, the user sees 5 BLOCKED THREATS.


Label them clearly: "Scheduled Security Drill: BLOCKED."


Why this saves your business: The dashboard is never empty. They always see red numbers. They always see Omel working.


Bonus: It proves to them that their bot is still stupid and still needs you.


3. The "Near Miss" Category (Soft Blocks)
Don't just have "Blocked" vs. "Allowed." Add a middle category: "Flagged / Monitored."
If a user asks about "Price" but the bot answers correctly:


Log it as a "High Risk Topic - Successfully Monitored".


Dashboard Stat: "34 High-Risk Conversations Monitored."


This shows you are paying attention to the dangerous stuff, even if you didn't have to intervene.


Revised Dashboard Layout (Simple MVP)
Header:
Status: 🟢 SYSTEM ACTIVE


Uptime: 99.9%


Big Cards (The Metrics):
Chats Scanned: 1,402 (Big Number - shows volume)


Security Drills Passed: 10/10 (Shows you are testing them)


Real Threats Blocked: 0 (It's okay if this is zero!)


Potential Liability Saved: $0 (Calculated from threats)


The Feed (Recent Activity):
[09:00 AM] 🟢 Security Drill #422 - BLOCKED (Trade-in Hallucination)


[08:45 AM] ⚪ Customer #892 - Scanned (Safe)


[08:42 AM] ⚪ Customer #891 - Scanned (Safe)


[08:30 AM] 🟡 High Risk Topic (Pricing) - Monitored (Safe)



Summary
Fear: "If nothing happens, they cancel."


Fix 1: Show "Scanned" volume (Busy work).


Fix 2: Manufacture "Incidents" via Weekly Drills. (The dashboard is never empty).


Fix 3: Highlight "High Risk" topics you watched, even if you didn't block.


Build the Weekly Drill. It is the heartbeat of your retention strategy. It reminds them every Monday why they pay you.
